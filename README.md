# task-manager-pro

Main Features:
1. Displaying Tasks - Users can view their current tasks along with their completion status and priority level.
2. Adding a Task - Users can add new tasks to their to-do list, providing a description of the task.
3. Marking Task as Completed - Users can mark tasks as completed once they've finished them, keeping their list up-to-date.
4. Setting Task Priority - Users can assign priority levels to their tasks, helping them prioritize and focus on what matters most.
6. Removing a Task - Users can remove tasks from their list that are no longer relevant or necessary.
